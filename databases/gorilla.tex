  \item Name: Pinglei Guo
  \item Assignment: Gorilla: A Fast, Scalable, In-Memory Time Series Database
  \item Last Modified: \today
\end{itemize}

1. What is the problem authors are trying to solve

\medskip

Build a time series database that support the high throughput need for facebook's
monitoring.

\bigskip

2. How does the authorsâ€™ approach or solution improve on previous approaches to that problem

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
  \item Use delta of delta to compress time series data with non fixed interval
  \item Use an in memory database instead of LSM like.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

3. Why is this work important

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
  \item The compress algorithm is simply but efficient
  \item It works for facebook
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

4. Your comments/questions

\medskip

Questions

\begin{itemize}
  \item It uses batching on logging, so latest data will lost if the server crashed, they flush log in batches to improve
  performance
  \item The opensource version comes out late 2016, and some ideas are different from
  the paper (people who wrote the paper are not people who wrote the paper),
  and it can be barely used as a database, it provides little API and some code are forgotten when they open source it.
  \item A lot of Facebook C++ libraries are used, so the core code is not very long
\end{itemize}

Miscellaneous

\begin{itemize}
  \item Contributed a Vagrantfile for the project
  \item Can only build on Ubuntu 16.10
\end{itemize}
