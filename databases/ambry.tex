  \item Assignment: Ambry: LinkedIn's Scalable Geo-Distributed Object Store
  \item Last Modified: \today
\end{itemize}

1. What is the problem authors are trying to solve

\medskip

Build a object storage system that support both large amound of very small file and large files for LinkedIn's media storage

\bigskip

2. How does the authorsâ€™ approach or solution improve on previous approaches to that problem

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
  \item HA and horizontally scalable
  \item Compared with linkedin's previous generation solution, the system is built on top of opensource softwares and no longer bounded to specific vendor
  \item GEO distributed, active-active
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

3. Why is this work important

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
  \item Media has unique access pattern, immutable, various size, streaming, read heavy, focus on recent data etc, thus exisiting system is not a good fit
  \item Media has become more and more important, with the trend of VR, the requirement for media storage system becomes higher
  \item Group object into partition to avoid the overhead of many small objects, use log to store blob.
\end{itemize}

4. Your comments/questions

Questions

\begin{itemize}
  \item The idea of using a preallocated log file to store blob, and has an index to locate blobs is relatively fresh to me, other parts are pretty similar to most systems.
  \item Ceph didn't rely on file system like ext and built their own file system layer to gain better control, I think this approach can also be taken.
  for media store
  \item I think small object and large object should be store in two different subsystem to gain better optimization, the need for images and video is totally different,
  there could be needs like filtering out video that contains illegal contents, which requires powerful CPU and/or GPU, and it might be a good idea to have the video data on
  the exact computing machine or very close to it.
