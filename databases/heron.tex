1. What is the problem authors are trying to solve

\medskip

Strom is hard to debug and low efficient and Twitter don't want to rewrite existing application using storm

\bigskip

2. How does the authorsâ€™ approach or solution improve on previous approaches to that problem

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
  \item better scheduling using external tools like Aurora
  \item add backpressure instead of fail fast
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

3. Why is this work important

\medskip

It reduce cost of hardware and keep the old applications running

\bigskip

4. Your comments/questions

\medskip

Questions

\begin{itemize}
  \item Chinese E-COM company Alibaba (Taobao) also have their own storm implementation called JStorm \url{https://github.com/alibaba/jstorm}
  \item Update: I found one of the author from Heron wrote a write up explaining differences (in Chinese though) \url{https://gist.github.com/maosongfu/c3aeb1bb5eb7b39fcdc5}
  \item Have twitter ever considering switching to other language to avoid GC, like somehow add an abstraction of existing application and
  compile the abstraction layer to C, and the application logic are compiled as code code template. I remember this is how ARIES managed their
  query logic, compile query into machine code and execute directly.
  \item For the GC problem, there is a Zero-GC JVM called Zing \url{https://www.azul.com/products/zing/} which claims to be used by trading companies,
  GC in trading means directly money lose, though I don't know how they sell this kind of JVM, one of its author is pretty active on China's Quora (Zhihu)
  \item I think due to growing and the large base of China's market, there will be more paper from China's tech companies in future top conferences.
  Though some of them treat open source and publication as part of the promotion and salary, I don't know what's the case in western companies.
