rules

- one idea per sentence or paragraph and one topic per section
- 不要太谦虚  ''可能大概在某些情况下提高了'
- 不要太装13  '我们把这种情况叫做 自己的名字 效应'
- 不要像推销商品一样
- use direct statements and expressions involving 'we' or 'I' - that is, the active voice - to make reading more pleasant and to help distinguish new results from old.
