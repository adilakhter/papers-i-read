# Chap 06 Good Style

- good writing and presentation can persuade readers that work is of value
- be clear, unambiguous, correct, interesting, and direct

## Economy

- Text should be taut (简洁)
- be ego-less - ready to dislike anything you have previously written

## Tone

- objective and accurate
- the primary objective is to inform, not entertain (Paxos)

rules

- one idea per sentence or paragraph and one topic per section
- 不要太谦虚  ''可能大概在某些情况下提高了'
- 不要太装13  '我们把这种情况叫做 自己的名字 效应'
- 不要像推销商品一样
- use direct statements and expressions involving 'we' or 'I' - that is, the active voice - to make reading more pleasant and to help distinguish new results from old.

## Examples

- use concrete small examples to make abstract concepts easier for people to understand
- one example one concept

## Motivation

- 承上启下

> Tell the reader what you are going to say, then say it, and then tell the reader that you have have said it

- explain things that reader may not know
  - writer may know it well since long time has been spent
- do motivate the right thing

## Balance

- each topic should be discussed to a similar depth

## Voice

- use `we`
- don't use passive voice unless needed
  - bad 'The following theorem can now be proved'
  - good 'We can now prove the following theorem'

## The Upper Hand

> Some authors seems to have a superiority complex - a need to prove that they know more or are smarter than their readers
> The only information conveyed is an impression of the author's ego
> Write for an ordinary reader, as your equal

## Obfuscation

- be accurate, did it or not, improved? how much

## Analogies

- what seems reasonable to the writer may not be the case for reader

## Straw Men

- 别瞎扯 (i.e. False history)

## Reference and Citation

> Don't add citations just to pad the bibliography
> Some readers of a paper will not have access to the publications it cites, and so may rely on the paper's description of them.
For this reason alone you should describe results from other papers fairly and accurately

- if you cite it because a paper you cite cite it, explicitly say that `According to A (as quoted by B), foo is bar`
- be objective about references, don't put (your) personal opinions (on readers)
- self reference should not be anonymous

Web pages

- use a durable URL

## Quotation

- double quote for short sentences
- indent block for long quotations
  - might require permission from the authors

## Acknowledgments

- only thank people that really helped
  - not the case for thesis I believe
