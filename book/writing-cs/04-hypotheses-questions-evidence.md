# Chapter 4 Hypotheses, Questions, and Evidence

- you need to have Hypotheses

## Hypotheses

- specific and precise, should be unambiguous
- it may be necessary to refine a hypothesis after initial testing
- first Hypotheses, then test
- if two Hypotheses fit observation equally well, pick the simpler one

## Defending Hypotheses

- always consider the possibility that your hypothesis is wrong
- the stronger your intuitive liking for a hypothesis, the more rigorously you should test it - that is, attempt to confirm it or disprove it - rather than twist results, and yourself, defending it

## Forms of Evidence

- proof
- model
- simulation
- experiment

## Use of Evidence

...

## Approaches to Measurement

- what is to be measured? and what measures will be used?
- optimization-to-a-measure is a problem

## Good and Bad Science

- some science is not simply weak, but can be described as pseudoscience
  - inconsistent internally

## Reflections on Research

> Two philosophers are arguing in a bar. The barman goes over to them and asks, 'What are you arguing about?'
> We are debating whether computer science is a science
> And what do you conclude?
> We're not sure yet We can't agree on what 'is' means

- falsification: experimental evidence, no matter how substantial or voluminous, cannot prove a theory true,
while a single counter-example can prove a theory false.
- confirmation: the weight of belief in the theory has been strengthened
