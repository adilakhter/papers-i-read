# Chapter 1 Introduction

- inexperienced researchers (look in the mirror) can
  - create a logical organization
  - use concise sentences
  - revise against checklists of possible problems
  - seek feedback
- A thesis is usually a deep or even definitive exploration of a single problem
  - should be an objective addition to scientific knowledge
  - **not a description of the path that was taken to the result**
- A typical research paper consists of the arguments, evidence, experiments,
proofs and background required to support and explain a central hypothesis

> writing is not the end of the research process, but instead shapes it
> Scientific results are only accepted as correct once they are refereed and published;
if they aren't published, they aren't confirmed

- skepticism is important
