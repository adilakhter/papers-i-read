# Chapter 3 Reading and Reviewing

- the average standard of work submitted or publication is well below that of work that gets published

## Research Literature

- papers are not textbooks, and should not be treated as textbooks

> The number of papers that a researcher working on a particular project has to know
well is usually small, even though the number the researcher should have read to establish
their relevance is large

- skip through the paper first, read thoroughly on interesting part (if any)
- don't allow reading to develop into a form of procrastination, it needs be part of a productive cycle of work, not a dominant use of time

## Finding Research Papers

- reading about a paper that seems relevant is never a substitute for reading the paper itself.
If you need to discuss or cite a paper, read it first.
- search, conference, arXiv, discuss your work with as many people as possible
- finding all relevant work is hard, finding all significant work is a critical part
- searching and reading are separate activities

## Critical Reading

- Much research - far too much - is just misguided
- respect other people's work but don't accept things blindly

## Developing a Literature Review

- do it progressively
- focus on organization and content instead of style
- in early drafts be inclusive, later comment out or move to other file

## Authors, Editors, and Referees

- it's the author's responsibility to ensure the contents of a paper are correct
- one may think their work is excellent and the negative comments are misguided
