# Chap 05 Writing a Paper

- Shaping the research and its outcome into a write-up is an effective way of giving
structure to a project, even if the work itself has not yet begun.
- three main phases
  - organizing materials so that the work tells a story
  - giving this story the structure of a thesis or of an academic paper
  - actual writing
- speculation through definition and experimentation to write-up

## The Scope of a Paper

First describe your aims

- write down everything that motivated you to start the research
  - what did you want to achieve
  - what problems did you expect to address
  - what makes the problem intersting

Next, define the scope of the work that you plan to write up

- what to include
- what might be be included
- which results are most surprising?
- what is the one result that other researchers might adopt in their work
- are the other outcomes independent enough to be published separatedly later on?
are they interesting enough to justify their being included
- who is the readership

Speculate on the format and scope of the results

> Stop undertaking new work and write up what has been achieved so far, completing
the old work is more important than try ton include too many results

Decide where the work might be published, audience, page limit etc.

## Telling a Story

- identifying what the reader needs to learn
- a story-like flow, start from common knowledge and reach new ideas and result
- body
  - a chain, problem, preview solutions and drawbacks, new solution, it's better
  - by specificity, multi stages, can be used within sections
  - by example
  - by complexity
- pyramid style
  - one line summary
  - summary w/ more context
  - detail

## Organization

having important statements as near the beginning as possible

### Title and Author

- use same style for name on all the papers, so that they are indexed together
- include a durable email address or web address
- include a date using `today`

### Abstract

- general statement introducing the broad research area of the particular topic being investigated
- an explanation of the specific problem to be solved
- a review of existing or standard solutions to this problem and their limitations
- an outline of the proposed new solution
- a summary of how the solution was evaluated and what the outcomes of the evaluation were

abstracts should be self-contained and written for as broad a readership as possible

### Introduction

- tell the result, don't keep it as secret

### Body

- in thesis, each chapter has an introduction and a summary of conclusion

### Literature Review

- for commercial products, they should be cited and noting the methods and effectiveness of the commercial solution are unknown.

### Conclusions

- Write "Conclusions", not "Conclusion"
  - write "Summary" if no conclusions to draw, which is used in end of thesis chapter

### Bibliography

### Appendices

- useul in a thesis

## The First Draft

- write freely - w/o particular regard to style, layout, or even punctuation - so that you can concentrate on presenting a smooth flow of ideas in a logical structure

> Authors who are too critical on the first draft are often unable to write anything at all.
I you tend to get stuck, just write anything, no matter how awful; but be sure to delete any ravings later

- describing the problem forces you to consider in depth the scope and nature of the research
  - if you find that you cannot describe the problem precisely, then perhaps your understanding is lacking or the ideas are insufficiently developed
- **the writing should begin as soon as the research is started**
- completing your reading, is a poor reason to defer writing, because reading is never complete; and in any case, the best way to develop your understanding of other papers is to write about them.
- writing is a stimulus to research, research is also a stimulus to writing

Thesis

- the most difficult chapter is usually the background and literature review
- introduction and be surprisingly challenging: achievement of a conversational, natural writing sytle can take many revisions

## From Draft to Submission

- a thesis is typically completed chapter by chapter.
- need to allow time for multiple revisions of each chapter
  - crucially, time for your advisor to read each chapter
- during drafting and revision, ensure that the topic of the paper does not drift
  - wrote down your aims, motivation, and scope use these as reference
  - changing the aims can affect the work in many ways, however, so only do so with great care.
- keep notes of
  - meetings
  - decisions
  - ideas
  - expectations of outcomes
  - papers you have read
  - sketches of algorithms
  - code versions
  - theorems
  - sources of data
  - experiments and outcomes
  - sketches of proofs

## Co-authoring

Two approaches

- each person difference section
- (preferred) take turns
  - requires agreed ground rules

## Theses

- the primary goal of a thesis is to produce a piece of work that the examiners will pass
- in a thesis, the primary element is the competence: whether the student has demonstrated that they are capable of undertaking independent research
- don't make grandiose claims about the work
- a thesis w/ negative results can, if appropriately written, demonstrate the ability of the candidate just as well as a thesis with positive results
- give reasons for accepts or reject other people's work or comments
- may report on a series of more or less independent research discoveries
- introduction should be broad in topic and conversational in tone
- browse other theses

## Getting It Wrong

- Irrelevance
  - wrong venue
  - no obvious research question, no statement of aims or goals, and no claimed contribution
- Inconsistency, Inadequacy, and Incompleteness
  - a sensible, well-organized paper may be framed in terms of grandiose, ambitious claims that can only be described as ridiculous
  - inadequate experiments, dataset is too artificial
  - parts of the paper are missing, or dealt with in a few brief lines rather than pages
  - some papers just aren't ready to be refereed; the underlying work is unfinished and the paper is incomplete
- Incomprehensibility
- Ugliness
- Ignorance
  - i.e. spend pages explain elementary concept
  - foolish opinions expressed as fact

## Checklist

Scope

- do you plan to publish?
- is the scope of the work well defined
- is there a single, clearly articulated research question or goal? Have you identified which aspect of the work is of greatest impact, or of greatest interest?
- what would success in the project look like? what would failure look like? can you anticipate the form of the outcomes in either case?
- who is the readership? how deep or thorough will the background need to be to ensure that the readers fully appreciate the work?
- co-author etc.

Organization and presentation

- form
- sections
- structure for the argument? a format for the results
- establish a connection between the question, background, methods and results?
- anything unusual about the organization, if so, why, and how to explain to the readers
- thesis formatting

Regarding your approach to the work

- maintaining a log and notebook
- explicit schedule with dates and targets
- do the deadlines leave enough time for your advisor to provide feedback on your drafts, or for your colleagues to contribute to the material?
- effective approach to write fast
- how to select and represent result
- have the results been critically analyzed
- in a thesis w/ multiple contributions, are they explicitly linked by an overarching goal?
