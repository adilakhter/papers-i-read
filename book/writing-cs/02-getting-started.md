# Chapter 2 Getting Started

- formation of a precise question
- develop a detailed understanding through reading etc.
- gather evidence that relates to the question, through experiment, analysis or theory
- linking of the question and evidence with an argument, that is, a chain of reasoning
- description of the work in a publication

> Part of learning to be a scientist is recognition of how the aims of research differ from those of coursework
> Publication is not an end in itself, but is part of an ongoing collaborative enterprise

## Beginnings

- Tea-room arguments are a rich source of seed ideas

## Shaping a Research Project

- 'is this advisor right for me', famous advisor isn't necessarily likeable or easy to work with
- 'is this project at the right kind of technical level'
- the barrier to entry, knowledge, infrastructure, resource etc.
  - as research fields mature, there is a tendency for the barrier to entry to rise
  - if a field is popular or well-developed, it may make more sense to explore other directions
- project scale is a related issue
- most research is to some extent incremental
- it's possible to investigate problems claimed to be solved by commercial products

## Research Planning

- having a series of deadlines is critical to the success of a project
- A strong approach to the task of defining a project and setting milestones is to explicitly consider what is needed at the end, then reason backwards
  - background review
  - related work
  - description of experiments
  - analysis of outcomes
- what form the experiments will take
  - data (ethics etc.)
  - code
  - platform
- what evidence must we collect to convince a skeptical reader that the results are correct
- estimate the dates at which milestones should be reached

> One of the axioms of research, however, is that everything takes longer than planned for.
even after taking this axiom into account

- **overlap stages as much as possible. You should begin the implementation, analysis, and write-up as soon as it is reasonable to do so**

## Students and Advisors

- give simple tasks w/ detailed steps, then give more space, from management to guidance
- an area where the advisor's expertise is critical is in scoping the project
- prepare for your meetings - bring tables of results or lists of questions

### Characteristics shared by successful research students

这段应该摘抄下来作为推荐信的模板...

- show a willingness to read widely, try things out, take part in the academic community
- have the enthusiasm to develop their interest in some area, and then ask for advice on how that interest can be turned into a thesis project
- have the ability and persistence to undertake a detailed (and even gruelling) investigation of a specific facet of a larger topic
- they take the initiative in terms of what needs to be done and how to present it, and gradually assume responsibility for all aspects of the research
- they are systematic and organized, and understand the need for rigour, discipline, stringency, quality, and high standards
- actively reflect on habits and working practices, and seek to improve themselves and overcome their limitations and knowledge gaps
- their work looks plausible, has the form and feel of high-quality published papers
- keep working despite some significant failed or unsuccessful activity
- **you don't need to be a genius**

## A Getting Started Checklist

- Is your proposed topic clearly a research activity?
- How is your project different from, say, software development, essay writing, or data analysis?
- In the context of your project, what are the area, topic, and research question?
- Is the project of appropriate scale, with challenges that are a match to your skills and interests?
**Is the question narrow enough to give you confidence that the project is achievable**
- Is the project distinct from other active projects in your research group?
Is it clear that the anticipated outcomes are interesting enough to justify the work?
- What resources are required and how will you obtain them?
- What are the likely obstacles to completion, or the greatest difficulties? Do you know how these will be addressed?
- Can you write down a road map, with milestones, that provides a clear path to the anticipated research outcomes
- Do you and your advisor have an agreed method for working together, with a defined schedule of meetings?
