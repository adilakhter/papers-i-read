# Introduction

## TODO

- [ ] column store with **virtual ids**

> these column-based systems enable queries to read just the attributes they need, rather than having to read entire rows from disk and discard unneeded attributes once they are in memory.

- Column Store with Explicit Ids
- [ ] Column Store with virtual ids

Tradeoffs

-'if a query needs to access only a single record, a column store will have to
seek serveral times to read just this single record'
