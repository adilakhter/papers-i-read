# 18 Imperative Objects

## 18.1 What is OOP

- [ ] TODO: why mention abstract data type?

Multiple representations

- dynamic dispatch
- contrast, ADT (abstract data type) consists of a set of values plus a single implementation of the operations on these values (Chap 24.2)

Encapsulation

- internal representation hidden from view outside of the object's definition

Subtyping

- the type of an object - its interface, is just the set of names and types of its operations

Inheritance

- subclassing
- [ ] TODO: subclassing vs. subtyping

Open recursion

- self, this
- late-bound
