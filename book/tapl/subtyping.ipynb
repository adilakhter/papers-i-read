    "- subtyping on record seems more like duck typing to me, see [HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13047934)\n",
    "- it seems ocaml's subtyping symbol is :> instead of of the <:, https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/html/book-ora144.html\n",
    "- evaluation rule is same, only typing rule is updated? https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/courses/seminar-ws02/Subtyping.slides.pdf\n",
    "- 15.2.5 exercies, if extend with product type T1 x T2 describted in 11.6, we can have depth subtyping rule, is it a good idea to add a width typing rule for produces as we did for record \n",
    "  - record (same as tuple) is T1 * T2 if I remember correctly, what's the T1 x T2 then? for variant, it's T1 + T2? is it?\n",
    "- in 15.5 Lists, mentionded covariant (records, variants, as well as function types on their right hand side) and contravariant (arrow, on the left-hand side) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)"
