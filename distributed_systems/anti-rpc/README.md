Questions

- The author mentioned 'major changes in implementation language is required in order to make local computing follow the model of distributed computing' in section 7 (taking the difference seriously). Is the the reason why language like Erlang, frameworks like Akka arise? Will those new languages and
frameworks be the ultimate solution or just another iteration like mentioned in section 3 (Deja Vu All Over Again)?

- sec.7 The author said `Distributed objects are different from local objects, and keeping that difference visible will keep the programmer from forgetting the difference and making mistakes` However, nowadays language, frameworks and Sass are trying to make reading manual and implementing business logic the major task for most programmers. Don't know if this is a good thing or not, if in the future machine can understand manual and glue code together like human, the CS department will have few applicants.
