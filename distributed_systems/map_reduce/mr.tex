1. What is the problem authors are trying to solve

\medskip

Build search index for Google Search Engine, i.e. inverted index. And other large
scale data processing using commodity hardware

\bigskip

2. How does the authorsâ€™ approach or solution improve on previous approaches to that problem

\medskip

MR abstracts the complex logic for distributed systems to end developer, they can
write simple logic and run it on thousands of machines concurrently and fault tolerantly.
Also optimization like combiner is taken to reduce network traffic.

\bigskip

3. Why is this work important

\medskip

It introduced a distributed file system, which lead to the widely used open source
implementation HDFS. It provides a simple approach for using a pipeline style to
decouple and re-assembly realtively complex tasks.
It gives direction so people created Hadoop and a whole eco-system around it.

4. Your comments/questions

Questions

\begin{itemize}
  \item Using a small amount of high end machine instead of a fleet of commodity machines
maybe faster and use less electricity. The data transportation between machines are pretty
high, and a small amount of high end machines are less likely to fail
  \item A lot of logic can not be written into the map reduce style efficiently,
and using map reduce leave little space for optimization
  \item Map Reduce is slow due to write intermediate result into distributed file system
  \item Hadoop is written in Java and Google's MR is written in CPP, how much performance impact
does using different languages bring
\end{itemize}

Miscellaneous

\begin{itemize}
  \item The concept of Map Reduce is not novel, but the distributed file system and resource management are good engineering solutions
\end{itemize}
