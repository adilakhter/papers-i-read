This paper is known as `FLP Impossibility`

> won the Dijkstra award given to the most influential papers in distributed computing, definitively placed an upper bound on what it is possible to achieve with distributed processes in an asynchronous environment [1]

It's the kind of paper that tells what can't be done in theory in order to guide people to spend more effort on what can be done.
But to be honest, I don't think this paper make itself easy for reader to understand.
A lot of definition are introduced, and readers need to follow step by step because if they miss one definition, they won't be able to
understand the next paragraph.
Existing summaries[1] can help understand this paper.
That's all, I need some soda.
