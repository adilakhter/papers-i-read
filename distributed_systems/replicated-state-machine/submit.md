# Submit: Implementing Fault-Tolerant Services Using the State Machine Approach: A Tutorial

This is a summary paper, and I think a good thing to do before reading a summary paper
is to look at the authors profile. Which would let you know if this a Prof. Alvaro's flavored
paper (abstract notations and a lot of logic stuff to cover a set of problems), or paper that
serves as an index. This paper is an combination, its an index to those papers with abstract notations (a lot of them are the authors own work). Looking at Prof. Schneider's publications (which is a lot, 178 published papers and 3,011 citation), you will find a lot of math(semantics)
papers like the 'Concepts and Notations for Concurrent Programming' one. (I think is more related
to programming languages)

btw: Prof. @pavlaro Are we going to talk about programing languages that is used in building distributed systems. A lot of languages says with their design, programmers can write robust large scale systems like playing with lego, like scala with Akka, Erlang etc. Do they really
improve something or they just start a new standard.
