For CMPS232 Fall16

## TODO

- [ ] read the paper
- [ ] write the summary

## Usage

- Ayi run build
- Ayi run bib
- Ayi run build

## Short summary

see [summary.md](summary.md)

Strong points

- better time space diagram an notation
- attach vector in message instead of a single timestamp, more information and compressed(just cardinality not all the events)
- a

Weak points

- the paper is too long
- a
- a

Questions

- what is atomic, does it have anything to do with the `atomic transaction` in database  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(order_theory)
- what is CSP,
- P7 Definition 3.1 mentioned consistent and characterize, I am sure Prof. Alvaro mentioned these in first or second class but I can't remember the context.
-

## Supplemental

- iff -> if and only if
- [ ] supremum in P5, what does it means
- isomorphic 同形的
- denote 象征 表示
