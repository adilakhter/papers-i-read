## 1. Intro

<!-- TODO: Add section for the following summaries -->

Fault is considered, no longer ideal, no FIFO.

standard enumeration of E_i

3 kinds of Events
- send event
- receive event
- internal event

Events are assume to be atomic (Q)

Do not deal with conflicts explicitly

causality relation (same as Lamport's happens before)

â€”> is
- irreflexive
- asymmetric
- transitive

P4 **the notion of consistency in distributed systems is basically an issue
of correctly reflecting causality.**

Applications

- obtain a consistent view in order to correctly evaluate the global predicate
- detect race condition and other synchronization errors
- proper replay of concurrent activities in distributed systems for the purpose of
debugging and monitoring

P4 [50] replay data can be reduced by appropriately representing the causal structure
of the computation.

- exploitation of Maximum parallelism

## 2. Causal History and Vector Time

C(e) contains all the events happens before e

when e is a receive event, s is the corresponding send event. C(e) = C(e_ij-1) U C(s) U {e_ij}

### 2.2 Vector Time

reduce call history size

P6 Rules to maintain vector time

- N Processes, initial V_i[k] = 0 for k = 1.... N
- each internal event V_i[i] := V_i[i] + 1
- send message m, update as 2), and attach the new vector to the message
- receive message m. update as 2), V_i := sup{V_i, V(m)}

## 3. Causality and Time

vector time's relation to real time.

the structure of vector time is isomorphic to the causality structure of the
underlying distributed computation.

**Definition 3.1** mentioned consistent and characterize

consistent - if
characterize - if and only if aka. iff

P7 **Definition 3.2** How to compare vector time

### 3.2 Real Time and Lamport Time

Lamport's happens before ... is somewhat misleading

ideal real time consistent with causality, but does not characterize causality

P8 **Definition 3.5** The Lamport Time

Lamport Time is insufficient to characterize causality.

## 4. Efficient Realizations of Vector Time

Drawback, size  -> efficient realization

### 4.1 Compressing Message Timestamps

observation -> the diff of vectors are small

impl of vector clocks, save bandwidth by increase storage

when send new message to P_j, only send the diff of the previous message. FIFO is
required. (The message can contains ID I guess)

Drawback of compress, lose immediate access to compare casual relationship between messages.
But full information can be recovred with O(N^2) space

### 4.2 Reconstructing Time Vectors

- length of msg still linear in worst case.
- more computation, not acceptable for running system but can be used for a trace based off-line analysis.

skip this part, yeah!

### 4.3 Size of the vector clocks

can't be smaller than N, still open problem

## 5. Characterizing Concurrency with Concurrent Regions

vector time can be used by too complex, so find another approach called concurrent region

concurrency map and dependence block

P18 concurrency map implicitly represents all possible total orderings which are consistent with causality.

### 5.2 Identifying Concurrent Regions with Region Numbers

region numbers must have essentially the same complexity as time vectors
