## Short summary

see [summary.md](summary.md)

Strong points

- Nice title, it's High Noon. (play of the game McCree)
- Finding the root cause it important than list all the procedures
- Reference is important and there is data for that

Weak points

- the introduction does not cover the paper well.

Questions

- The use of DAG reminds me of dead code elimination in compiler design. I think there are some connection.
- The network part and graph part reminds me of machine learning stuff. Maybe it's just net reminds of neural network.
- Is it possible to extend it to more than network diagnostics?
