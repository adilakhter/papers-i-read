# RPC

For CMPS232 Fall16

- [Implementing Remote Procedure Calls](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~zaher/classes/CS656/birrel.pdf)

Related to [anit-rpc](../anti-rpc)

## TODO

## Short summary

see [summary.md](summary.md)

Strong points

- good graphs, they take a lot space, so the paper is really not that long. And take
those implementation detail into consideration, it does not take a long time to read.
- TBD
- TBD

Weak points

- The hardware is pretty old compared with what we have these days
- Too much language or platform specific features are used ie: `RPCRuntime is a standard part of the Cedar system`, `These are the basis of the Mesa`. The author is assuming
readers know their stack well. However it is possible that it's the defacto stack at that
time.
- It's more close to engineering, (too much) detail of implementation are included. ie: in binding->naming->Grapevine DB. It may be good for programmers at that time but since I never heard of the DB and the language and their feature-rich system Cedar, I find it boring and weaken the point of the paper.

Questions

- In intro->structure->binding, it mentioned naming, is this the same `naming` appeared in reading list topic.
- TBD
