## Short summary

see [summary.md](summary.md)

Strong points

- Industry guys have different focus with system researchers (like the slide from Yahoo talking about BFT)
- It's not about how fast consensus protocol can be optimized to, it's about the worst outcome adopting consensus can cost
- Virtualization will be the trend (back in 2008) (Now we have docker which is even lighter resource sharing and isolation)
- Power management is important (include job scheduling) (Seems to be the reason we have system like Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm for machine/vm/container management)

Weak points

- Some traditional companies and not considered, ie: bank, government. Which also have large system and rely on high end hardware. (Maybe because the print the money so they don't worry about the budget) what's their focus and what can their focus inspire researchers
- Little points from researchers, give you a feeling that it's the people from the industry dominated the workshop (conference)

Questions

- It seems a lot of system researchers are entering the role of industry by making their research product commercialize, like Ceph is acquired by RedHat Mesos has Mesosphere, Spark has databricks. Does this have side effect on research directions, like Ivo has also mentioned Ceph is now directed by industry and community for large scale on commodity hardware, while the paper talked a lot about HPC.
- Most PhD students goes to industry after they graduate (considering the number of positions in Universities and Companies), will
they have more advantage compared with their fellow undergraduate/master students who spent years in industry while they spent time in academic?
- The LADIS workshop seems stopped on 2015 http://ladisworkshop.org/ ?
