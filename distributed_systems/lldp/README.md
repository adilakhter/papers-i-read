## Short summary

see [summary.md](summary.md)

Strong points

- Bloom L extend Bloom and with a few modification on the existing code base
- DSL is a good thing for developers, at least people are familiar with ruby like syntax
- Set is not enough, need more built-in lattice.

Weak points

- The development of bloom seems stopped. (But it got some new commit in the sandbox repo just few days ago)
- The naming in bloom (L) is not very straight forward (to me), like the operators
- The Dynmao like system is built by people who created bloom (L), it would be more convincing if someone else built it and run in real environment

Questions

- One section talked about performance, but does performance important for bloom and similar DSL?
- Is it possible to build relational data store using bloom?
- Why choose Ruby for bud, while Molly go with Scala?
- Bloom has so many issues https://github.com/bloom-lang/bud/issues Why not list it as part of project ideas?

Miscellaneous

- Paxos by Prof. Alvaro https://github.com/bloom-lang/bud-sandbox/tree/master/paxos (Unfinished)
