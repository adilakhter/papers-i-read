This is a paper summary for Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System\cite{l} by Lamport\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport}}.
It is the assignment of CMPS232-Fall16\footnote{\url{https://github.com/palvaro/CMPS232-Fall16}}.
% TODO: better 1-2 line summary
In this paper Lamport introduced logical clocks for ordering event totally thus solving synchronization problems like mutual exclusion.
It is widely used in both academy and industry.

\subsection{Introduction}

\begin{quote}
  A distributed system consists of a collection of distinct processes which are
spatially separated, and which communicate with one another by exchanging messages. \\
  A system is distributed if the message transmission delay is not negligible compared
to the time between events in a single process.\cite{l} \\

% TODO: right align and add a horizontal line
\textit{Leslie Lamport}
\end{quote}

The order of event is simple if we only consider physical time, like I woke on 8:00AM happens before
I eat my breakfast on 8:30AM.
But communication takes time due to spatial separation or other facts.

% TODO: a real word example
% FIXME: this example still feels quite wired
I woke up on 8:00AM, send a message to Jack on 8:05AM and ate breakfast on 8:10AM, Jack saw the message
on 8:30AM.
So although in physical time breakfast \textit{happens before} Jack saw the message, they are \textit{concurrent}
in the view of the system.

\subsection{The Partial Ordering} \label{PO}

Order need to be observed with the system.
Physical clocks are not perfectly accurate and do not keep precise physical time\cite{l}.

Define \textit{happens before} ($\rightarrow$) as following

\begin{enumerate}
  % TODO: may use the word in paper directly for PO1, due to C1
  \item \label{PO1} Inside a process, $\rightarrow$ is just like physical time.
  \item \label{PO2} If message is sent from process $P_i$ to $P_j$,
  $a$ is the sending of the message,  $b$ is receiving of that message, then $a \rightarrow b$.
  \item $if\ a \rightarrow b\ and\ b \rightarrow c, then\ a \rightarrow c$.
  % TODO: IMPL the counter implementation
  \item $if\ a \centernot\rightarrow b\ and\ b \centernot\rightarrow a$, then a is \textit{concurrent} with b.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Logical Clocks}

Define \textit{Clock} $C$ as following\cite{l}

\begin{itemize}
  \item just a way of assigning numbers to event, no relation with physical time, can be implemented using mere counter.
  \item $C_i$ for each process $P_i$ where a number $C_i\langle a \rangle$ is assigned to event $a$ in that process.
  \item function $C$ represents the entire system of clocks, so $C\langle b \rangle = C_i \langle b \rangle$ if $b$ is an event in process $P_i$.
\end{itemize}

Define \textit{Clock Condition} as following

\medskip

For any events $a, b$: if $a \rightarrow b$ then $C\langle a \rangle < C\langle b \rangle$

\medskip

By extending \ref{PO1} and \ref{PO2} in \ref{PO} we have

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{C1} C1. If $a$ and $b$ are events in process $P_i$, and $a$ comes before $b$, then $C\langle a \rangle < C\langle b \rangle$\cite{l}
  \item \label{C2} C2. If message is sent from process $a$ to $b$, then $C\langle a \rangle < C\langle b \rangle$\
\end{enumerate}

By extending \ref{C1} and \ref{C2} we have the implementation rule

% TODO: IMPL 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{IR1} IR1. Each process $P_i$ increments $C_i$ between any two successive events\cite{l}.
  \item \label{IR2} IR2.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If event $a$ is the sending of a message $m$ by process $P_i$, then $m$ contains a timestamp $T_m=C_i\langle a \rangle$\cite{l}.
    \item Upon receiving a message $m$, process $P_j$ sets $C_j$ greater than or equal to its present value and greater than $T_m$\cite{l}.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Simple implementation}

Some simple C code could do that

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <stdio>

int main(char* args){
  print("Hello Clock!")
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Problem solved}

It solved the following problems

determine order partially and totally. % TODO: why is this important

The paper solve the problem of total ordering in distributed system.
It is, because it can solve many synchronization problems.

By introducing logical clocks and a method to adjust physical clocks.

\subsection{Alternative}

No, no alternative for logical clocks. Oops I guess there are, things
like vector clock and stuff may work LOL. believe it or not.

\section{Related research}


Too many related researches

You can find more in \ref{l1}
You can also use page \pageref{l1}

\section{Q\&A}

% TODO: got this question when writing the introduction part
Q: When deal with message, the 'time' of send and receive message is regarded as same timestamp? \\
A: The clock must ticks between the message,  % TODO: find the pos in paper


Q: How visualize the space-time diagram to 3D \\
A: IDK

The example in this paper use a lot of assumptions to simplify the proof.
In real world applications, how engineers deal with these assumptions like messages
arrive in order.

I want to cite\cite{l}

\section{Supplemental Materials}

\subsection{Terms} \label{l1}

Since most terms I learned about math and computer science was in Chinese. I found a lot of terms blocking
me from understanding this paper, so are listed them below for fellow students whose mother language is not English.

\medskip

% TODO: may use subsubsection

Converse, Inverse, Contrapositive\footnote{\url{http://hotmath.com/hotmath_help/topics/converse-inverse-contrapositive.html}}.
Given a statement $if\ p, then\ q$, $p$ is called hypothesis, $q$ is called $conclusion$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Converse  $if\ q, then\ p$
    \item Inverse $if\ not\ p, then\ not\ q$
    \item Contrapositive $if\ not q, then\ not\ p$
\end{itemize}

If the statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.
And the inverse is the contrapositive for the converse, so if the inverse is true, the converse is true.

\medskip

% FIXME: this website has annoying ads, why its the first result in google
Mutual Exclusion\footnote{\url{https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25629/mutual-exclusion-mutex}}
also known as mutex, which you may have heard it when reading books about multithread.
It is \textit{a program object that prevents simultaneous access to a shared resource}.
