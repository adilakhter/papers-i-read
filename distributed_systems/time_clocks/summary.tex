\begin{abstract}

This is a paper summary for Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System\cite{lamport1978time} by Lamport\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport}}.
It is the assignment of CMPS232-Fall16\footnote{\url{https://github.com/palvaro/CMPS232-Fall16}}.

\section{Paper walk through}

This paper mainly covers the following part.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Partial Ordering
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Definition of order, what is \textit{happens before}, Symbol $\rightarrow$. % the arrow http://garsia.math.yorku.ca/MPWP/LATEXmath/node9.html
      \item space-time diagram
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Logical Clocks
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item 2 Clock Condition, one inside process (C1), one between process, measured by message (C2).
      \item improved and 3-D space-time diagram.
      \item 2 Implementation Rule, one inside process (IR1), one between process , measured by message, $T_m = C_i<a>$ (IR2).
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Ordering the Events Totally
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Definition of total ordering using Logical Clock and order among processes, Symbol $\Rightarrow$
      \item Solve mutual exclusion problem, fixed number of processes share a single resource.
      \item Specify the synchronization as a State Machine.
      \item Pitfall, handling failure (related paper is referred).
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Anomalous Behavior
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Precedence information based on messages external to the system cause anomalous behavior.
      \item Solution 1, \textit{explicitly introduce info about the ordering $\rightarrow$ to the system} by user.
      \item Solution 2, Strong Clock Condition, thus use Physical Clocks to eliminate anomalous behavior.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Physical Clocks
  % TODO: this part is a lot harder, and I skipped the Proof of the Theorem in appendix /w\
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Requirements for the clock, individual (PC1), between clocks, small variation (PC2).
      \item Requirements for preventing anomalous behavior.
      \item Algorithm to ensure PC2, clock synchronization.
      \item The length of time for synchronizing clocks.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Simple implementation}

Some simple C code could do that

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <stdio>

int main(char* args){
  print("Hello world?")
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Problem solved}

The paper solve the problem of total ordering in distributed system.
It is, because it can solve many synchronization problems.

By introducing logical clocks and a method to adjust physical clocks.

\subsection{Alternative}

No, no alternative for logical clocks. Oops I guess there are, things
like vector clock and stuff may work LOL. believe it or not.

\section{Related research}


Too many related researches

You can find more in \ref{l1}
You can also use page \pageref{l1}

\section{Q\&A}

The example in this paper use a lot of assumptions to simplify the proof.
In real world applications, how engineers deal with these assumptions like messages
arrive in order.

I want to cite\cite{lamport1978time}

\section{Supplemental Materials}

\subsection{Terms} \label{l1}

Since most terms I learned about math and computer science was in Chinese. I found a lot of terms blocking
me from understanding this paper, so are listed them below for fellow students whose mother language is not English.

\medskip

Converse, Inverse, Contrapositive\footnote{\url{http://hotmath.com/hotmath_help/topics/converse-inverse-contrapositive.html}}.
Given a statement $if\ p, then\ q$, $p$ is called hypothesis, $q$ is called $conclusion$.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Converse  $if\ q, then\ p$
    \item Inverse $if\ not\ p, then\ not\ q$
    \item Contrapositive $if\ not q, then\ not\ p$
\end{itemize}

If the statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.
And the inverse is the contrapositive for the converse, so if the inverse is true, the converse is true.

% FIXME: this website has annoying ads, why its the first result in google
Mutual Exclusion\footnote{\url{https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25629/mutual-exclusion-mutex}}
also known as mutex, which you may have heard it when reading books about multithread.
It is \textit{a program object that prevents simultaneous access to a shared resource}.
