## Introduction

- 'Based on the difficulty of factoring large integers'
- use pub key to encrypt message, us private key to decrypt message
- use private to sign a message, use pub key to verify

gcd Greatest common divisor, also known as gcf, greatest common factor

所有数都只有一个质数分解? Yep

d 其实是个 trap door

phi function,


Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.

- euler's totient function 只是减一，而且还可以相乘
- relatively prime (co prime) - do not share a common factor except 1
