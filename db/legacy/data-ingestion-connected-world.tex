3. Why is this work important

\medskip

\begin{itemize}
  \item It combines a lot of features together, ACID, High load, order, distributed.
  Which makes the near real time analysis realtively easy.
  \item Compared with other TSDBs, it add the stream processing
\end{itemize}

Questions

\begin{itemize}
  \item For time series data, he mentioned the order and accuracy is important.
  But I disagree with that, first a lot of time series data can tolerate data lost, if
  I lost 100 points in 1000000 points, it's likely my analysis will be almost the same.
  Also there is really no need to keep order of time series data, like he said near real time
  analysis is important, and keep order can only slow things down.
  \item The idea of using memstore and diskstore is similar to LSM Tree, most modern
  systems have adopted this kind of architecture
